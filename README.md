## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

You'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer or use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

$ git clone https://github.com/samiurprapon/samiurprapon.github.io.git

# Go into the repository
$ cd samiurprapon.github.io

# Install dependencies
$ npm install

#Start's development server
$ npm start
```

## Personal details Customization

#### Personalize page content in `/src/portfolio.js` & modify it as you like.

```javascript
/* Change this file to get your Personal Porfolio */
const greeting = {
  username: 'SamiurPrapon',
  title: "Hi, I'm Prapon",
  subTitle: emoji(
    'I love to interact with Humans & Machines from an Abstract level. üöÄ'
  ),
  resumeLink:
    '',
  displayGreeting: true, // Set false to hide this section, defaults to true
};

const socialMediaLinks = {
  /* Your Social Media Link */
  github: "https://github.com/samiurprapon",
  linkedin: "https://www.linkedin.com/in/prapon/",
  gmail: "samiur.prapon@gmail.com",
  facebook: "https://www.facebook.com/prapon14"
};

## Linking Portfolio to Github

Generate a Github personal access token following these [instructions](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line) (make sure you don't select any scope just generate a simple token).

### 1. **Generate a Github Personal Access Token.**

Generate a Github personal access token using these [Instructions](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line) or simply go and generate from [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens).

**`Make sure you don't select any scope just generate a simple token without any scope`**

After that copy your generated token and then encode your token into base 64 using this [Website](http://www.utilities-online.info/base64/)

`Copy your base64 converted token`

### 2. **Change `/src/config.js`.**

Go to your cloned repository and make the following changes in `/src/config.js`

```javascript
const config = {
  // Github Converted Token from -> https://www.utilities-online.info/base64
  githubConvertedToken: "Your access token here",

  // Github UserName
  githubUserName: "your github username",
};
```

3. That's it! üòÉ



### Using Emojis

For adding emoji üòÉ into the texts in `Portfolio.js`, use the `emoji()` function and pass the text you need as an argument. This would help in keeping emojis compatible across different browsers and platforms.


### Deploying to Github Pages

This section guides you to deploy your portfolio on Github pages.

- Navigate to `package.json` and enter your domain name instead of `https://samiurprapon.github.io/` in `homepage` variable. For example, if you want your site to be `https://<your-username>.github.io/developerFolio`, add the same to the homepage section of `package.json`.

- Add `<your-username>.github.io` to `package.json` as both are exactly same. Upon doing so, you tell `create-react-app` to add the path assets accordingly.

- Optionally, configure the domain. You can configure a custom domain with GitHub Pages by adding a `CNAME` file to the `public/` folder.

- Follow through the guide to setup GitHub pages from the official CRA docs [here](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#github-pages).


Or, you can use `Github CI` to do the job for you.
- Generate personal token from `https://github.com/settings/tokens` as `PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` & `WEBSITE_SECRET`
- add those secrect on `https://github.com/<your_username>/<repository_name>/settings/secrets/actions`
- Open `.github\workflows\deploy.yml` and configure 
```yml
      run: |
        git config --global user.email "your_mail"}
        git config --global user.name "your_name"
        git remote set-url origin https://${{secrets.PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN}}@github.com/<your_username>/<repository_name>.git
        CI=false npm run deploy
      env:
        REACT_APP_GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{secrets.WEBSITE_SECRET}}
```

### Overcome Github Page Limitation

I found, Github removes personal tokens on each deployment because of it's security policy. So, what I simply did, manually set the response when it doesn't get the result. As example,  `/src/containers/projects/Projects.js`
```javascript 
    .then((result) => {
        setrepoFunction(result.data.user.pinnedItems.edges);    
    })
    .catch(function (error) {
        // console.log(error);
        let repo = {
          data: {
            user: {
              pinnedItems: {
                totalCount: 6,
                edges: [
                  {
                    node: {
                      name: "JWT-Authenticaton-server",
                      description:
                        "Simple and effective method of developing JWT. Token based authentication",
                      forkCount: 0,
                      stargazers: {
                        totalCount: 0,
                      },
                      url:
                        "https://github.com/samiurprapon/JWT-Authenticaton-server",
                      id: "MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMjE5NzEwODY=",
                      diskUsage: 53,
                      primaryLanguage: {
                        name: "JavaScript",
                        color: "#f1e05a",
                      },
                    },
                    ...
                  },
                ],
              },
            },
          },
        };
        
        setrepoFunction(repo.data.user.pinnedItems.edges);
    }

```

Similarly, I put profile data mannually on `/src/containers/profile/Profile.js`

```javascript
    let result = {
        "data": {
            "user": {
                "name": "Samiur Prapon",
                "bio": "‚ô¶Ô∏è World is Diamond Shaped.",
                "isHireable": false,
                "avatarUrl": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25266703?u=f5614b531668cbd808573f709329e5f105339879&v=4",
                "location": "Bangladesh"
            }
        }
    }
```
